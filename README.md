# Sahaba-Names

This repository hosts the code for the "Search Sahaba" website, a comprehensive database of hundreds of Sahaba (companions of the Prophet Muhammad). Users can easily browse the list and click on any Sahaba's name to open a new tab with detailed information about them. This project is our real-world Islamic initiative. Future updates will include additional features and functionalities to enhance the user experience.
